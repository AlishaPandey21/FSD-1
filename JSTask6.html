<!-- Task :6

Create a user verification form containing two input fields (Employee ID and Department Name) and a Verify button. Implement the following functionalities without using regular expressions:

While typing in the Employee ID field, if the entered value contains any non-numeric character, the text color should change to red; otherwise, it should remain black (oninput).

When the user leaves the Department Name field after making changes, its background color should change to light yellow (onchange).

When the mouse pointer moves over the form, the form’s border color should change to gray (onmouseover).

When the mouse pointer leaves the form, the border should return to black (onmouseout).

Add a separate button labeled “Clear Fields” that empties both input fields when clicked (onclick).

Add a separate button that toggles the form’s background color between white and lightblue (onclick). -->
